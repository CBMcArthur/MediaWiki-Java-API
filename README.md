MediaWiki-Java-API
==================

My (partial) implementation of MediaWiki.org's API in Java.

Assuming I've worked out the issues between Eclipse, EGit and GitHub, there should now be code for the MediaWiki Java API 
online.  The base code is included with minimal documentation in the com.kirkman_enterprises.MWJAPI.MediaWikiBot.java 
file.  More documentation and explanation may be coming in the future, particularly if there are requests to do so.
